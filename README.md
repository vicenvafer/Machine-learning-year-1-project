# Machine-learning-year-1-project
The project consists of 4 python files: a file that records the frames of the hands, one that draws the lines of the hand gestures and gives it x and y values, one that trains the model given those x and y values, and one that uses that model to interpret the letters gestural notation and outputs the letter as an answer.
